# IdeaVim-EasyMotion

[![][jetbrains-team-svg]][jetbrains-team-page]
[![][apache-license-svg]](LICENSE)

Created for [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim)  
Powered by [AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086-acejump)

[EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) plugin emulation for IdeaVim.


#### Setup

- Install [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim),
[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086-acejump) and
[IdeaVim-EasyMotion](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13360-ideavim-easymotion/) plugins.
- Add `set easymotion` to your `~/.ideavimrc`

#### How does it work?

Please check the docs of the [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion#usage-example-for-the-base-features) plugin.

Keep in mind that labels should be typed in lower case. 

#### What are the features of this new plugin and how does this plugin differ from AceJump?

- With IdeaVim-EasyMotion, you get good integration with IdeaVim.
    - Now you can use EasyMotion commands as an argument for `d`, `c`, or any other command that takes motion as an argument.
    - Use your existing EasyMotion mappings or create new mappings that will work both in Vim and IdeaVim.
    - If you use the `iskeyword` option, check out the ` <Plug>(easymotion-iskeyword-*)` commands.
- There is now an additional set of commands. Use `<Plug>(easymotion-e)` to jump to a word end, or `<Plug>(easymotion-sl)` for jumping within the line. See the [full list of supported commands](#supported-commands).

#### Keep typing

You donâ€™t have to limit yourself to using only one char of the target word. Type as many chars as you need.

#### AceJump mapping

For it to work properly, the mappings of IdeaVim-EasyMotion should be
executed instead of AceJump mappings. This plugin maps the shortcuts
of AceJump to the corresponding actions in IdeaVim-EasyMotion to
improve the experience of AceJump users. You can disable this feature by
adding `let g:EasyMotion_override_acejump = 0` to your `~/.ideavimrc`.

An additional feature of this plugin: AceJump jumps will be added to IdeaVim jump list (no need for `set easymotion`).

#### `mapleader` mapping

If you want to change your leader key, please make sure the `mapleader` command appears before the `set easymotion` command in your `~/.ideavimrc`:
```
let mapleader=","
set easymotion
```

#### Supported options:

- `g:EasyMotion_re_anywhere` - Regex for `<Plug>(easymotion-jumptoanywhere)`.
- `g:EasyMotion_re_line_anywhere` - Regex for `<Plug>(easymotion-lineanywhere)`.
- `g:EasyMotion_do_mapping` - Set this option to 0 if you want to disable the default mappings.
- `g:EasyMotion_startofline` - The default behavior of the |j| and |k| is to move your cursor to the
                                     start of the line. Set this option to 0 to force the cursor to stay in
                                     the same column.

#### Supported commands:
80 of the original 87 vim-easymotion commands are supported.  
[Here](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion/blob/master/doc/easymotion.txt) you can get
the description of each `<Plug>` command.

> - `<ll>` means that you have to prefix the command with `<leader><leader>`.
  So, type `<leader><leader>w` to execute `<ll>w` command.
> - The default `<leader>` key is `\`. Use `\\w` to perform word motion if you don't have any overrides.
> - You can change the default prefix using mapping to `<Plug>(easymotion-prefix)`.
E.g. use `map <Leader> <Plug>(easymotion-prefix)` to change the prefix to a single leader - `\w`.
